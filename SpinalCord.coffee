# SpinalCord.js
#
# Requires jQuery, Underscore.js, and Backbone.js
#
# An extension to Backbone.js hence SpinalCord.js
# 
# Builds upon the functionality of Backbone by adding more built-in classes, and features.
# 
# The current list includes:
#   - Error Reporting, baked into Views (Ã  la Rails' flash) (SpinalCord.ErrorView)
#
#   - Layouts, a way of wrapping a view in a default context that surronds the generated
#     view, insures the view contains the correct static content, but allows it to be redrawn
#     without worry.
#
#   - Authenticated Models and Collections, a simple way of ensuring HTTP Basic Auth credentials 
#     are always attached to fetch() requests, and therefore passed all the way down to Backbone.sync()
#
#   - Utility Functions
#
#   - Enhancements to Routing, allowing for greater freedom in controlling the flow of the 
#   - Application in the form of SpinalCord.Application
#
#   - User Model, a simple user model that provides integrated authentication, just
#     provide the isAuth function.
